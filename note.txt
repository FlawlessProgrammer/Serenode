<!-- Design a modern, minimalist website for a creative brand named “Serenode”.
The brand offers video editing, development, and design services with a calm, intentional, and growth-focused approach.

Background: #f5f5f5 (off-white)

Text/Logo: #006579 (deep teal)

Accent: #7ceeb (light cyan)

Optional accents: #B87A57 (warm clay), #3A4649 (slate gray)
